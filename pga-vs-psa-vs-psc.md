# Private Google Access vs Private Service Access vs Private Service Connect

This document explains the differences between **Private Google Access (PGA)**, **Private Service Access (PSA)**, and **Private Service Connect (PSC)** in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These services enable private connectivity to Google Cloud services and resources, but they serve different purposes and have distinct use cases.

## Overview
Google Cloud provides multiple private access options to allow Virtual Machine (VM) instances in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to connect to Google services or managed resources without requiring public IP addresses. These options enhance security by keeping traffic within Google's network, avoiding the public internet.

- **Private Google Access (PGA)**: Enables VMs with only private IP addresses to access Google APIs and services.
- **Private Service Access (PSA)**: Facilitates private connections to Google-managed services (e.g., Cloud SQL, Memorystore) using VPC peering.
- **Private Service Connect (PSC)**: Offers flexible, service-oriented private connectivity to Google APIs, managed services, or third-party services using endpoints or backends.

## Private Google Access (PGA)
**Private Google Access** allows Compute Engine VMs without external IP addresses to access Google APIs and services (e.g., Cloud Storage, BigQuery) using their external IP addresses, but the traffic remains within Google's network. It is configured at the subnet level and relies on DNS entries to route traffic to predefined Google IP ranges (e.g., `private.googleapis.com`).

### Key Features
- **Configuration**: Enabled per subnet, requires a default internet gateway route or specific routes for Google API IP ranges (e.g., 199.36.153.8/30).
- **Access**: Supports a predefined set of Google APIs and services (see [Supported Services](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-access-options)).
- **DNS**: Uses private DNS zones (e.g., `*.googleapis.com`) to resolve to private IP ranges.
- **Limitations**: Less flexible, as it uses shared Google IP ranges and does not allow custom IP addresses. VMs with external IPs bypass PGA.

### Example
```bash
# Enable PGA on a subnet
gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME \
  --region=REGION \
  --enable-private-google-access
```

## Private Service Access (PSA)
**Private Service Access** enables private connections between your VPC and a service producer’s VPC (e.g., Google-managed services like Cloud SQL or Memorystore) using VPC Network Peering. It requires allocating an IP range for the service producer’s network to avoid IP overlap.

### Key Features
- **Configuration**: Requires allocating an IPv4 CIDR block and creating a VPC peering connection using the Service Networking API.
- **Access**: Supports specific Google-managed services (e.g., Cloud SQL, Memorystore) and third-party services hosted in a VPC.
- **Traffic**: Traffic stays within Google’s network, and VMs can use internal IPs to communicate with service resources.
- **Limitations**: Limited to services supporting PSA. IPv6 is not supported, and it requires careful IP range management.

### Example
```bash
# Allocate an IP range for PSA
gcloud compute addresses create RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
  --global \
  --purpose=VPC_PEERING \
  --addresses=192.168.0.0 \
  --prefix-length=16 \
  --network=VPC_NETWORK

# Create a private connection
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
  --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
  --ranges=RESERVED_RANGE_NAME \
  --network=VPC_NETWORK \
  --project=PROJECT_ID
```

## Private Service Connect (PSC)
**Private Service Connect** provides a modern, flexible way to connect to Google APIs, Google-managed services, or third-party services using private IP addresses. It uses endpoints or backends to route traffic within your VPC, offering granular control.

### Key Features
- **Configuration**: Create PSC endpoints (using forwarding rules) or backends (using network endpoint groups) to access services.
- **Access**: Supports Google APIs (e.g., Cloud Storage), Google-managed services (e.g., Cloud SQL), and third-party services (e.g., Snowflake, Confluent).
- **Flexibility**: Allows custom internal IP addresses in your VPC and supports load balancers for advanced configurations.
- **Global Access**: Can enable cross-region access within the same VPC if configured.

### Example
```bash
# Create a PSC endpoint for Google APIs
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create ENDPOINT_NAME \
  --region=REGION \
  --network=VPC_NETWORK \
  --address=IP_ADDRESS \
  --target-service-attachment=SERVICE_ATTACHMENT_URI
```

## Comparison Table

| Feature                     | Private Google Access (PGA) | Private Service Access (PSA) | Private Service Connect (PSC) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Access Google APIs/services | Access Google-managed services | Access Google APIs, managed services, or third-party services |
| **Configuration**           | Subnet-level, DNS-based     | VPC peering, IP range allocation | Endpoints or backends, custom IPs |
| **IP Management**           | Shared Google IP ranges     | Reserved CIDR block for service producer | Custom IPs in consumer VPC |
| **Flexibility**             | Less flexible, all-or-nothing | Limited to supported services | Highly flexible, granular control |
| **Supported Services**      | Google APIs (e.g., Cloud Storage) | Cloud SQL, Memorystore, etc. | Google APIs, managed services, third-party |
| **VPC Peering**             | Not required                | Required                     | Not required (software-defined) |
| **Use Case**                | Simple API access           | Managed service access       | Advanced, cross-VPC, or third-party access |
| **Ease of Setup**           | Easy                        | Moderate                     | More complex, but flexible |

## Use Cases
- **PGA**: Ideal for VMs without public IPs needing access to Google APIs (e.g., a VM accessing Cloud Storage via `storage.googleapis.com`).
- **PSA**: Suitable for accessing Google-managed services like Cloud SQL or Memorystore privately within a VPC.
- **PSC**: Best for scenarios requiring custom IP addresses, cross-VPC connectivity, or third-party service access (e.g., Snowflake, Confluent).

## One liner
PSC is a more powerful way to privately connect to Google APIs and services, covering what PGA and PSA do, plus extra capabilities like connecting to third-party services or using custom IPs
